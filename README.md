# postman-api-testing
This API Testing project presents a well-structured Postman test suite built to validate core CRUD operations of a sample Product Management API. The collection includes automated test scripts covering response code verification, schema validation, data integrity checks, and negative scenario testing for robust error handling. All assertions are written using Postman’s JavaScript testing framework to maintain consistency and accuracy across endpoints.
The project highlights practical QA capabilities such as API test design, parameterized requests, environment configuration, chained workflows, and automated validations. It reflects solid familiarity with REST best practices and aligns with testing approaches commonly applied in product-based, fintech, and cloud-driven environments.
